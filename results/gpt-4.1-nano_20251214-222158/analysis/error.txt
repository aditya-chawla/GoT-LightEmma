  (8.800, -0.0005),
  (9.005, -0.0005),
  (9.210, -0.0005),
  (9.415, -0.0005),
  (9.620, -0.0005),
  (9.825, -0.0005)
]

These adjustments reduce abrupt acceleration and steering changes, ensuring a gentle, steady progression along the lane with minimal curvature jerk while maintaining the current lane position.
scene-1100          7         Revised actions for smoothness and feasibility, maintaining speed and following the curve to the right:

1. (1.0, 0.04)
2. (1.2, 0.06)
3. (1.4, 0.08)
4. (1.6, 0.10)
5. (1.8, 0.12)
6. (2.0, 0.14)

These adjustments reduce abrupt speed changes and curvature jerk, ensuring steady forward progress along the curved road.
scene-1100          12        Revised actions (tuple points) for smoothness and feasibility:

[
  (0.552, 0.11),
  (0.852, 0.15),
  (1.152, 0.19),
  (1.442, 0.24),
  (1.732, 0.29),
  (2.012, 0.34)
]

These points suggest a gentle acceleration (+0.3) with a slight right turn (+0.05), while reducing abrupt speed spikes and maintaining smooth forward movement within bounds.
