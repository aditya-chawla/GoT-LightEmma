scene-0061          0         Looking at the scene and intent, I need to continue the moderate deceleration pattern while maintaining lane position.

Given:
- Current speed: 7.273 m/s (decelerating trend)
- Intent: Decelerate 1-2 m/s over 3s (0.33-0.67 m/s²)
- Past curvatures: near-straight with minimal variation
- Need to maintain safe distance from white van ahead
- Pedestrians and construction barriers require caution

Applying smooth deceleration and minimal curvature adjustments:

[(7.05, 0.001), (6.83, 0.001), (6.61, 0.000), (6.39, 0.001), (6.17, 0.001), (5.95, 0.000)]
scene-0061          1         Looking at the scene with pedestrians crossing, construction barriers, and the white vehicle ahead, I need to ensure smooth deceleration with minimal curvature changes while maintaining safety. The critique asks for reducing speed spikes and curvature jerk while keeping forward progress feasible.

Here's the revised trajectory with smoother deceleration and consistent near-zero curvature:

[(6.7, 0.002), (6.4, 0.002), (6.1, 0.002), (5.8, 0.001), (5.5, 0.001), (5.2, 0.001)]
scene-0061          4         Looking at the scenario, I need to:
1. Decelerate heavily (5-6 m/s reduction from current ~6.3 m/s)
2. Steer slightly right to avoid construction and position for narrowed lane
3. Maintain smooth transitions over 3 seconds (6 timesteps at 0.5s intervals)

Starting from speed 6.315 m/s, I'll apply aggressive deceleration to reach near-stop while smoothly increasing right curvature from the current 0.005.

The speed reduction should be approximately 1.0 m/s per timestep initially, then tapering off as we approach stop. The curvature should increase smoothly to reflect the slight right adjustment, peaking mid-maneuver then stabilizing.

[(5.3, 0.008), (4.2, 0.012), (3.0, 0.015), (1.8, 0.014), (0.9, 0.011), (0.4, 0.008)]
